## Title
“The Irish all love Guinness, right?”: Are beer preferences culturally acquired and what are the other geographical factors influencing beer preferences and consumption?

## Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
Many countries have (perhaps stereotypical) associations with different beer preferences. Since geographical data is available for both breweries and users, it should be possible to test  whether there is substantive geographical variation in beer preferences and in the type of language used in reviews. It would be very interesting to test rural vs urban differences by incorporating census data e.g. US census data https://data.census.gov/cedsci/. This immediately lends itself to further extensions with other variables of interest e.g. one can investigate the relationship with political leanings, average wealth, alcohol laws etc.

## Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline

## Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone P3.

## Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
