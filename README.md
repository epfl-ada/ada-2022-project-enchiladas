## Title
“The Irish all love Guinness, right?”: Are beer preferences culturally acquired and what are the other geographical factors influencing beer preferences (and consumption) => we don't have data on consumption?

## Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
Many countries have (perhaps stereotypical) associations with different beer preferences. For example, one might think the Germans all love <instert german beer> but judge <instert irish beer> with the highest contempt. By utilizing the data from two of the biggest beer ranking website, this project will investigate wether there exist a "home" biais when users rate beers. Morover, we will look at other geographical-based factor that could biais reviews.

Why ? How?


Since geographical data is available for both breweries and users, it should be possible to test  whether there is substantive geographical variation in beer preferences and in the type of language used in reviews. It would be very interesting to test rural vs urban differences by incorporating census data e.g. US census data https://data.census.gov/cedsci/. This immediately lends itself to further extensions with other variables of interest e.g. one can investigate the relationship with political leanings, average wealth, alcohol laws etc.

## Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Do home biais exist amongst different us-states and countries
- What are the other factor that influence consummer ratings based on their location ?
- In particular:
    - urban vs. rural
    - alcohol policies
    - welath
    - politics

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
