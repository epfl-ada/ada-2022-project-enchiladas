## Title
“The Irish all love Guinness, right?”

## Abstract
### A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
Many countries have (perhaps stereotypical) associations with different beer preferences. For example, one might think the Germans all love Helles but judge Guinness with the highest contempt. We aim to investigate if there truly is such a geographical and cultural influence on beer preferences by looking at differences in language, ratings and rating criteria. Furthermore, it is also often said that beers taste better at home. Certain countries also have different ways of discussing and critiquing beers. We are also interested in seeing if this can be linked to how international and open a country is to foreign beers. By utilizing the data from two of the biggest beer ranking websites, this project will be able to investigate whether there exist a "home" bias (preference for local produce) when users rate beers. Moreover, we will also look at other geographical-based factor that could bias reviews.

Why ? How?


Since geographical data is available for both breweries and users, it should be possible to test  whether there is substantive geographical variation in beer preferences and in the type of language used in reviews. It would be very interesting to test rural vs urban differences by incorporating census data e.g. US census data https://data.census.gov/cedsci/. This immediately lends itself to further extensions with other variables of interest e.g. one can investigate the relationship with political leanings, average wealth, alcohol laws etc.

## Research Questions
### A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Are beer preferences influenced by geography/culture?
- Do different cultures prioritise/prefer different aspects of beers such as feel?
- Do different cultures have stylistically different ways of writing reviews and discussing beer?
- Is there a "home bias" for reviewers? I.e. do users rate local beers higher than their foreign counterparts?
- Do home bias exist amongst different us-states and countries
- What are the other factor that influence consumer ratings based on their location? In particular, in the US we can look at:
    - urban vs. rural
    - wealth
    - politics

## Proposed Additional Datasets
### (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
- Per-state population, wealth (median income) is available from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Data size is negligible. For each state, we will collect two numbers: the population and the median income.
- Per-state voting in presidental elections is available from the [Harvard Election Data Science Lab](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX). Again, the data size is minimal and for each state we will just collect the votes for Republicans and votes for Democrats.
